Assalamu'alaikum brothers and sisters.

Here is **AL-MUQADDIMAT-UL-QISKIT**. A project I sincerely develop to help people get start with qiskit.
I made this reposity from programmer perspective, try to use least word and more code of summary. 
So those who want to get to get familiar with the tools could just look up to this reposity.

Quantum Computing still have various programming libraries to simulated its properties.
Reason I pick qiskit is 
 1. It is the most popular tools in this field
 2. I do use it in my lab.

In this field, there still vast sea from theorerist views to programmer views, no matter how much you interest in 
quantum computing, just think of this as **Intro** or **Recap** book, as I named it "Al-Muqaddimah" which mean "introduction".
